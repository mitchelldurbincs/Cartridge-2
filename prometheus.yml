# Prometheus Configuration for Cartridge2

# Scrape targets:
#   - Actor:   http://alphazero:9091/metrics (self-play metrics)
#   - Trainer: http://alphazero:9090/metrics (training metrics)
#   - Web:     http://web:8080/metrics       (game server metrics)
#
# Note: Actor and trainer run in the same container (alphazero),
# so they expose metrics on different ports.
